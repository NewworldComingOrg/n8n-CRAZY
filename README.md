## N8n Ultimate Scraper: Scraper for N8n builders

N8n Ultimate Scraper is an open-source framework designed for N8n builders who want to use an efficient and scalable scraper for their projects.

Our web scraper can find any data displayed on a webpage and can also use cookies to log in to the targeted webpage.

## How It Work
The scraper takes the following input parameters:
 - Subject (e.g., Hugging Face)
 - Domain name/website (e.g., github.com)
 - Targeted data (e.g., number of followers)
 - Website cookies (optional for authentication)

 The result of this request will be a structured JSON containing the number of followers on the Hugging Face GitHub page.


## ðŸš€ Getting Started

**Docker Compose Setup for n8n and Selenium**
This repository contains a Docker Compose configuration for deploying [n8n](https://n8n.io) and Selenium standalone Chrome services.

Follow these steps to deploy the services using Docker Compose:

### Prerequisites

1. **Docker**: Ensure Docker is installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
2. **Docker Compose**: Ensure you have Docker Compose installed. You can check by running:
   ```bash
   docker-compose --version
   ```

### Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository that contains the `docker-compose.yml` file and the `.env` file.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Touxan/n8n-ultimate-scraper.git
cd n8n-ultimate-scraper
```

### Configure the Environment Variables

Modify the `.env` file in the root directory modify the necessary environment variables for `n8n` and `selenium`.

```bash
# .env
# N8n Variables
N8N_BASIC_AUTH_ACTIVE=true
N8N_BASIC_AUTH_USER=n8nuser
N8N_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD=n8npassword

# Selenium Variables
HTTP_PROXY=http://proxyAdress:port
HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxyAdress:port
```

Make sure to replace `n8nuser` and `n8npassword` with more safer values.
Make sure to replace `proxyAddress` and `port` with the actual values for your proxy.

### Deploying the Services

To deploy the `n8n` and `selenium` services, run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will:
- Spin up the `n8n` service and expose it on port `5678`.
- Spin up the `selenium` Chrome standalone service and expose it on port `4444`.
- Connect both services on a custom Docker network.

### Accessing the Services

- **n8n**: You can access `n8n` by navigating to [http://localhost:5678](http://localhost:5678) in your browser. 

- **Workflow**: You can import on your n8n the Selenium_Ultimate_Scraper_Workflow.json and activate it 
  
### Request the workflow

To request the workflow you can start with this cur command : 
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5678/yourwebhookid \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "subject": "Hugging Face",
  "Url": "github.com",
  "Target data": [
    {
      "DataName": "Followers",
      "description": "The number of followers of the GitHub page"
    },
    {
      "DataName": "Total Stars",
      "description": "The total numbers of stars on the different repos"
    }
  ],
  "cookie": []
}'
```

### Stopping the Services

To stop the running containers:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

This will stop and remove the containers, but your data will be persisted in the `n8n_data` volume.
